# Potential Homework Problems
### CS 196 Spring 2016
These are problems that might be assigned as homework in UIUC's spring 2016 CS 196 class.

## Variables

* Create a variable `a` and assign the value `5` to it. Then, create another variable `b`, which is equal to two less than `a`.
  * What is the type of `a`?
  * What is the type of `b`?
* Suppose you are running the Python interpreter and there is a variable `a`, but you don't know the value of `a`.
  * In the Python interpreter, how can you determine the value of `a`?
  * In the Python interpreter, how can you determine the type of `a`?
  * If you aren't in the Python interpreter, how can you determine the type of `a`?
* Suppose `a = 1` and `b = 1.2`. What is the value of `a + b`? Create a new variable `c` and assign that value to it.
  * What is the type of `a`?
  * What is the type of `b`?
  * What is the type of `c`?
  * What do you get when you add an `int` to a `float`?
* Suppose you have a variable `s`. Assign `"Hello, World!"` to `s`.
  * What is the length of `s`?
  * How can you determine the length of an arbitrary `str`?
  * How do humans refer to variables of type `str`?
  * What does the expression `s * 2` evaluate to?
